				<p>I have a dear friend, Michael, for whom I wanted to get 
				a special gift so I immediately thought of Alex Geer and 
				his beautiful house portraits. I drove to Mike's house, 
				snapped pictures from many different angles. I sent Alex my 
				favorite image and indicated which elements were important 
				to include in the final work (in this case it was the old 
				lamp post).</p>
				<p>Alex's pen and ink drawing of the home was beautifully 
				rendered, but just as importantly, it was warm and personal...
				literally. It took my breath away when I first saw that 
				gorgeous work of art. Michael was ecstatic and obviously 
				touched.</p>
				<p>We had note cards printed up of this drawing and I have a 
				shopping bag and face masks printed with images of my own 
				home, also created by Alex. It's the gift that keeps on giving! 
				I can't think of a more meaningful gift for a friend, 
				family member or customer!</p>
